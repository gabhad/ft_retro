# ft_retro

## Description

This project is a simple implementation of the Space Invaders game in C++, using the ncurses library for the graphical interface. The game is played using the arrow keys to move the spaceship and the spacebar to shoot. The goal is to destroy all the invaders before they reach the bottom of the screen.

## Installation

## Prerequisites

Ensure that the `ncurses` library is installed on your system. On Debian-based distributions, you can install it with the following command:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
```

## Compilation

To compile the game, simply use `make` in the project directory:

```sh
make
```

## Execution

Once the compilation is complete, you can run the game with the generated executable:

```sh
./ft_retro
```

## Usage

Use the arrow keys to move the spaceship.
Press the spacebar to shoot at the invaders.

## Project Structure

src/ : Contains the source files of the game.
include/ : Contains the header files.
Makefile : Build file to compile the project.
README.md : This file.


## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! If you want to improve the game or add new features, feel free to open a pull request.


## Future potential updates :

Maybe : add new weapons

Maybe + : add external objects bonus/malus

Maybe ++ : add boss fights + level design
